## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the login and registration forms.
- `s6.css`: Custom CSS file for additional styling (to be created as needed).
- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file for handling form submissions and toggling between forms (to be created as needed).

## Setup

1. **Download the Project Files**
   - Ensure you have the `index.html`, `s6.css`, and `scripts.js` files in your project directory.

2. **Include Bootstrap**
   - The project uses Bootstrap for styling. Ensure you have the Bootstrap CSS included in the `<head>` section of your `index.html`.

3. **Custom Styling**
